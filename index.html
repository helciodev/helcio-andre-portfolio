            <p>
              I lost myself in space and time coding.
              <br />
              I always knew I would work with technology one day since I saw my
              cousin's PlayStation the first one from 1999 and my fascination
              with technologies only grew. So when it came to starting my life
              as a University student choosing computer engineering was a
              no-brainer. The problem is that at University I was not learning
              how to code and the curriculum at the time was outdated, thatâ€™s
              when I discovered online courses and decided to take matters into
              my own hands but with soo much to learn and no direction feeling
              overwhelmed was natural, but after discovering Udemy I decided to
              learn HTML and CSS. And that's when it happened; the spark I was
              missing ignited the instant I realized how much cool stuff I can
              build with these two technologies. Since then, I can't get enough.
              building stuff with technologies calls to all my passions; it
              incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to
              break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of
              course).
